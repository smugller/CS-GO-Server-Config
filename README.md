# Welcome!

Hi! I'm here to help people to organise and sorted CS:GO client and server config for best performance and set it up for classic rules.

# CS:GO Server Config

Below you have some useful script to start your journey with customize your config.

## Syntax highlighting for VSCode with .cfg file support

This plugin for Visual Studio Code help you read .cfg source files. It's workaround plugin and didn't highlight all cvars so keep that in mind. These repo need to be updated anyway in the future.

## How to get all latest cvars from source engine?

Plugin to reveal all console variables/commands that are marked as hidden/development-only. It's nice to check time to time for deprecated or new cvar commands.

Ready to view all cvar commands (check the date and time for latest updates) in these repo. You can easily look for all CS:GO cvars alongside ones marked as hidden/development-only. Repo is contributed by ArminC.
